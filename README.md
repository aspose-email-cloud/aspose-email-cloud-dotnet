Aspose.Email Cloud is a REST API for creating email applications that work with common email file formats. It lets developers manipulate message formats such as Outlook MSG, EML and MHT files.

To use these SDKs, you will need App SID and App Key which can be looked up at [Aspose Cloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) (free registration in Aspose Cloud is required for this).

## How to use the SDK?
The complete source code is available in the GIT repository.
